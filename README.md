# Numerical-PDE-project

Overview

This project aims to find numerical solutions for a system of 3D partial differential equations defined on the domain Ω = (-1, 1) × (-1, 1) × (-1, 1). The system of equations involves six different fields (F1 to F6), with boundary conditions and parameters set for different values of σ (0.1, 1, 10, 100). The project uses the Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SGS) method with Newton iteration to solve the system and analyze the convergence of the solution.
